# Changelog

## 0.3.3 — 2026-07-03

- **Fix: delegate crash on read-only files** — delegate now resets file permissions before writing, preventing EACCES errors when PROJECT_PLAN.md is read-only from a previous sync
- **Fix: plan.json not updated on crash** — assignments are now written to plan.json before any file writes, ensuring sync always finds correct assignments even if delegate crashes later
- **Fix: resilient file writes** — all file writes in delegate are wrapped in try/catch, so one failure doesn't crash the entire delegation
- **Owner-only guard** — `plansync delegate` now checks if the current user is a repo admin before allowing delegation. Collaborators cannot accidentally overwrite the plan.
- **--update flag** — `plansync delegate --update` intelligently updates existing Issues instead of creating duplicates. New tasks create new Issues, changed tasks update existing Issues, removed tasks close their Issues with a comment.
- **--supervisor flag** — `plansync sync --supervisor` keeps all files writable while still generating context files. Ideal for project owners who need to oversee all tasks without scope restrictions.
- **Improved scope manifest paths** — fixed path display in delegate output to use relative paths instead of absolute paths

## 0.3.2 — 2026-07-03

- **Windows compatibility** — browser opening now supports `start` (Windows) alongside `open` (macOS) and `xdg-open` (Linux)
- **Windows clipboard** — `clip` command added for Windows alongside `pbcopy` (macOS) and `xclip` (Linux)
- **Cross-platform shell syntax** — removed Unix-specific `2>/dev/null || true` from delegate.js, replaced with try/catch

## 0.3.1 — 2026-07-03

- **Website updates** — all pages reflect per-user context files (generated at sync time, not delegate time)
- **workflow.html** — updated delegate/sync descriptions, end-to-end example with numbered menu
- **install.html** — next steps now mention context file generation
- **index.html** — delegate step no longer mentions context files; sync step does
- **faq.html** — context files description updated

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-03

- **Per-user context files** — context files are now generated at `plansync sync` time, not delegate time. Written to `.plansync/context/<username>/`, gitignored, containing only that user's assigned tasks. All 7 agent templates updated.
- **Numbered reassignment menu** — delegate now shows a numbered task + lettered collaborator menu. Input formats: `"1=b"`, `"1,3=b"`, `"all=a"`. No more typing task IDs and usernames.
- **Fallback for invalid assignees** — if a user isn't a collaborator, the issue is created without assignee and a comment is added with the intended username.
- **Plan.json updated with assignments** — delegate now writes `assignedTo` back to `.plansync/plan.json` so `sync` can read them.
- **--auto flag** — `plansync delegate --auto` skips interactive reassignment but still shows the approval prompt.
- **Context files gitignored** — `.plansync/context/` is now added to `.gitignore` during init.

## 0.2.5 — 2026-06-27

- **README** — added prominent website link at top

## 0.2.4 — 2026-06-27

- **LICENSE** — updated copyright to Howards254

## 0.2.3 — 2026-06-27

- **install.html** — added "Next steps after init" with two-column guide (new project vs existing project)
- **docs.html** — each command now has its own section with detailed explanation and a concrete terminal example
- **Sidebar navigation** — docs.html sidebar links directly to each command anchor

## 0.2.2 — 2026-06-27

- **Website redesign** — new workflow.html guide (new project vs existing project), streamlined install and docs pages
- **Auto-version badge** — homepage fetches latest version from npm registry automatically
- **Active nav links** — current page highlighted in site navigation

## 0.2.1 — 2026-06-27

- **Interactive browser dialog** — countdown 5s then auto-opens browser; user can open, copy URL, or cancel
- **Fixed delegation reassignment** — case-insensitive task ID matching; reassignments no longer overwritten by re-distribution
- **Fixed printf bug** — `%s` replaced with template literals throughout
- **Untracked config.json** — `git rm --cached` removes previously committed `.plansync/config.json`
- **Fixed scopes** — `['repo', 'project']` so Issues + Project board both work
- **Deprecation suppressed** — Octokit uses `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28`
- **Status table** — header separators aligned

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-27

- **Fixed device flow scopes** — removed invalid `issues` and `project` scopes; `repo` alone covers everything
- **Fixed project board creation** — uses `repoData.owner.node_id` instead of repo node ID for ownerId
- **Auto-distribute delegation** — tasks are assigned round-robin to collaborators; review and reassign before committing
- **Pre-assigned plans** — if `plan.json` tasks have `assignedTo` set, uses those directly
- **Gitignore secrets** — `.plansync/config.json` added to `.gitignore` during init; excluded from git add in delegate
- **`plansync clean`** — new command to remove all PlanSync files, markers, and hooks

## 0.1.4 — 2026-06-27

- **Device flow is primary** — press Enter to authenticate in your browser; paste a PAT as fallback
- **Built-in Client ID** included — no setup whatsoever for the default auth path

## 0.1.3 — 2026-06-27

- **PAT-first auth** — `plansync init` prompts for a Personal Access Token; press Enter to fall back to device flow
- **Built-in Client ID** — no OAuth App setup needed for device flow; a default Client ID is bundled
- **verifyPAT()** — validates token by calling GitHub API and returns the authenticated username

## 0.1.2 — 2026-06-27

- **Interactive client ID prompt** — `plansync init` no longer requires `PLANSYNC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` env var; prompts for it if missing and saves to config
- **Context files for 7 agents** — AGENTS.md (28+), CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, copilot-instructions.md, GEMINI.md, .continue/rules/00-plansync.md
- **Website cleanup** — removed Anthropic/LLM/API-key-first messaging; agent-native flow is the lead story
